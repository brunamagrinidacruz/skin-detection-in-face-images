# Skin Detection in Face Images

## Objective

Given an image of a face, identify a person's skin and return an image with just the skin.

## Input images

The application input is images of faces. 

The source of the images is the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA). CelebA is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. 

The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter. CelebA has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations, including:
- 10,177 number of identities;
- 202,599 number of face images;
- 5 landmark locations, 40 binary attributes annotations per image.

The complete list of facial attributes provided by CelebA is:
